                <h3>What is my interest in IT?</h3>
                <p>
                    Learning IT can help us develop and design software, games, web pages and other projects. I think this is the most attractive and interesting aspect of it. 
                    When I was in high school, I began to be interested in IT. At that time, I liked video games very much, and I was also very interested in the design and programming of these games. In addition, teachers always recommend us to use a lot of educational websites and software when we study in school, and I am very interested in the design of these applications and websites in the process of learning. 
                    The person who influenced me to form my interest in IT is my brother. My brother majored in IT in University. After graduation, he found a company engaged in software development. When he was working at home, I often watched him., so it also inspired my interest in IT. 
                    About IT experience, I think I still lack a lot. In the past, I learned more about programming through reading books, but I haven't done some project practice yet.

                <h3>Why do I choose RMIT?</h3>
                <p>
                    There are three reasons why I choose to study in RMIT. First of all, through my own understanding and friends' introduction, I think the teaching quality of RMIT's IT major is very good, and I think RMIT will teach me the professional knowledge I need. 
                    Secondly, the employment rate of RMIT students majoring in IT is very high. I think my study in RMIT can help me find a job that I am satisfied with. Thirdly, I like the teaching and learning atmosphere of RMIT very much. There are a lot of exchanges and discussions between our classmates and teachers. 
                    I think this is a very important point that can help me learn better.

                <h3>What do I expected to learn in RMIT?</h3>
                <p>
                    I hope I can learn more about the development and design of websites and software in RMIT. Although I have learned some programming knowledge, but I have not participated in a lot of website and software project development work, for the development project experience is too little. In addition, I also hope to carry out more project cooperation in RMIT learning. Through the cooperation, I can learn how to contribute to the team and cultivate my sense of cooperation.
