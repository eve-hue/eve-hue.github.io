                <h3>Overview</h3>
                <p>
                    This project is to make a smartphone application that can specifically help the elderly read newspaper news. 
                    Compared with some news applications with a large number of complex navigation bars and information bars in today's mobile application market, 
                    this application for reading news for the elderly will have an application interface and user experience closer to paper newspapers. These changes
                    will help the elderly more freely read newspapers with their mobile phones instead of holding a large number of paper newspapers in their hands.
                </p>
                <hr>
                <h3>Motivation</h3>
                <p>
                    Faced with the rapid growth of modern information technologies, Chinese newspapers have begun to aggressively embrace digitalization by using advanced information 
                    processing and communication technology (Song, Shao & Wu, 2010). The proportion of Chinese internet users aged 60 and up increased from 6.7 to 11.2 percent. In China, 
                    the net number of older netizens nearly doubled from 60.5 million in March 2020 to 110.8 million in December 2020, while the proportion of netizens aged 60 and older 
                    increased from 2.1% (13.3 million) to 6.7% (59.0 million) between June 2014 and June 2019 (Yao & Zhang 2021). Reading newspapers is the daily habit of the elderly in China, 
                    and the mobile Internet has become a part of the life of the elderly in China. However, in the old media, with the increase of the age of the elderly, their eyesight will gradually 
                    decline. The small font and a large number of text content of paper newspapers have caused great trouble to the reading of the elderly. Many elderly people now need to wear glasses 
                    or even magnifying glass to read newspapers. Therefore, I hope to develop a simple mobile newspaper application to help the integration of new media and paper newspapers, which may 
                    help the elderly to read and subscribe newspapers more easily. I think the newspaper application for the elderly will have a good market in the elderly group.

                <h3>Description</h3>
                <p>
                    The difference between news mobile applications and traditional newspapers is actually the difference between new media and old media. New media is more interactive and timely, utilizing digital media, 
                    which promote the process of engaging with the public in order to learn about their trends and examine their positions and interests, as well as using them in investigative journalism and press surveys 
                    (Al-Khasht, 2021). In addition, the mass and sharing of new media is incomparable to the traditional old media. The advantages of new media are undeniable, but the reality is that young people are still 
                    the main users of new media (Arnett, Larson & Offer, 1995). For the mobile news applications in today's mobile application market (such as CNN and Sina News applications in China), these applications contain 
                    a large number of international and social news contents, which are in line with the cognitive tendency of young people, but these are not the news contents often involved by the elderly. The old people pay more 
                    attention to the trivial news in their life, and they accept the information broadcast which is more inclined to the daily life. Therefore, the content direction of news application in the market is obviously not 
                    suitable for the elderly. The results show that, despite the rising number of older Internet users, this group continues to stick to old media patterns, with only a small percentage embracing new ones. This trend tends to 
                    be universal, with little cross-national variations (Nimrod, 2017). Today's news applications in the market have complex navigation bar and news section, which are the reasons why the elderly donâ€™t adapt to mobile applications. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    The three most important aspects of my application project are: the visibility of the interface, the simplicity of operation and the convenience of reading. We need to collect and investigate the newspapers read by the elderly and 
                    establish a cooperative partnership with the corresponding newspapers. We hope that the newspapers can upload the newspapers to our mobile applications in the form of electronic version. In terms of our interface design, the design 
                    interface of this application should be different from the application in today's market. Remove the complicated navigation bar and information section, then add different newspaper categories (such as China's Yanzhao Evening News and 
                    The People's Daily) to our home page, so that users can directly find the newspaper they like to read. In terms of operation, the subscription of paper newspapers usually requires users to go to the post office to handle the corresponding 
                    business and fill in various personal information, which is very cumbersome for the elderly. However, when we publish different newspapers in the application, we will also add the subscription function to renew and unsubscribe directly in the 
                    corresponding newspaper section. This will facilitate the elderly to handle the relevant business on their own, which is much more convenient than offline subscription. In addition, this app will also add a collection function, the collection 
                    button will be added at the top of the electronic newspaper, which will make it easier for the elderly to find newspapers they haven't finished reading. Finally, the most important aspect is the convenience of reading. I hope that the elderly 
                    can get the same experience as reading paper newspapers when using this app, because it won't make the elderly feel very uncomfortable about the way of browsing news like other news apps. To achieve this, I think there are several aspects that need 
                    to be designed. Firstly, users will not use the slide down method to browse the news. The page turning function will be added to the reading mode. Users only need to slide their fingers to make the same page turning action as the reality, and then 
                    they will read the next part. This is to help old people keep the same reading habits as before, so that the elderly will not feel strange about the way they read. Secondly, in the reading mode, we will divide the contents of newspapers according to 
                    the distribution of title, we will enlarge each part of the contents, and then display them to the user's mobile phone screen in sequence according to the newspaper order. After reading the current content, users only need to slide their fingers to continue 
                    to read the next part. The main purpose of enlarging the font is to avoid the difficulty of the old people in seeing the words clearly, at the same time, the division of newspaper content will avoid the elderly from missing relevant information in reading.
                </p>

                <h3>Tools and Technologies</h3>
                <p>
                    In the application design, Photoshop may be used for graphic design to determine the appearance and interface of the application. In addition, Eclipse, a free open source development tool, will be used for software development. If the development is based on Android system, 
                    Android studio (with IntelliJ code editor and developer tools) will be used to improve the efficiency of android app development. If it is based on IOS system, Xcode will be used for application development, Slicy and Indigo studio will be used for icon design and UI prototype design. 
                    In addition, there are also some app production tools for "programming free" development, such as Appmakr, Appcan and Appbyme.
                </p>
                <hr>
                <h3>Skills Required</h3>
                <p>
                    For the programming, this project needs to master Java, C + + and other high-level languages to write. In the Java direction, we also need to know the basic knowledge of computer software, SQL server and database principles. In addition, Android App design involves XML, we also need to 
                    understand the programming method of Android. In the aspect of news application design, we should also understand the business process between the software administrator and the user, as well as the main functions of the news system, and know how to realize the page turning, subscription and other functions of the newspaper in the application.
                </p>
                <hr>
                <h3>Outcome</h3>
                <p>
                    If the project is successful, then the elderly will no longer need to order paper newspapers for reading. People can read newspaper news through mobile phones, so as to save a lot of trouble in subscribing to paper newspapers. In addition, the page design and font design of newspaper applications will help the elderly get rid of the trouble of 
                    reading newspaper words and speed up reading news, which makes it easier for the elderly to get outside news. The development of newspaper news in the mobile terminal is not only conducive to improving the elderly group's experience of reading news, but also can reduce the pressure of printing newspaper and distribution. In addition, the reduction of 
                    newspaper printing will also reduce the production of paper, it is also conducive to the protection of the natural environment, which is a direction of sustainable development.
