                <h3>Job description</h3>
                <p>
                    This position requires a front-end focused web developer to work with the design team and back-end team to integrate 
                    the appearance of the application and related technologies, so as to help users achieve the best use experience.
                    The reason why this position attracts me is that I like the working philosophy of this team very much. They focus on and enjoy their own work. 
                    They like challenges and also pay attention to the sense of team participation. The most important thing is that they are committed to helping 
                    us create a pleasant environment. I think these concepts are very consistent with my career goals and pursuit. In addition, the front-end developer is 
                    also one of the jobs that I am very interested in. After some basic learning of the front-end of web pages, I am also very interested in the front-end developer.
                    I think it will be a position that I like very much.
                </p>

                    Photoshop and illustrator asset export or preparation, as well as the corresponding interface construction and mobile device support knowledge. In addition to the 
                    requirements of relevant skills and knowledge, the position requires candidates to have at least 3 years of experience in front-end website development, a good 
                    sense of teamwork and the ability to constantly learn innovative skills.

                <h3>The skills, qualifications and experience I currently have</h3>
                <p>
                    I have mastered some basic knowledge of website front-end (HTML, CSS2 & 3 and JavaScript), I have also learned some website design principles, familiar with user-centered 
                    design content, and have a certain understanding of user needs and experience. In addition, I also participated in some website front-end design projects (including webpage 
                    front-end programming and page design), and also had some experience in website user experience survey.
                </p>

                <h3>My plan</h3>
                <p>
                    In terms of technical requirements, first of all, I need to complete the advanced learning of CSS2 & 3 and JavaScript to consolidate the foundation and further study. 
                    Secondly, I don't know enough about bootstrap responsive framework and jQuery 3 +, so I need to spend some time to learn relevant knowledge. In addition, this job requires 
                    at least three years of front-end website development experience, so I need to participate in more front-end website development projects to improve my work and development ability.
