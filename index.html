                Hello everyone, I come from China, my major is information technology. I have completed the first two years of my studies in a university in China, 
                and I will finish the rest of my studies in RMIT in the last two years, I hope to learn more professional IT knowledge in RMIT.
                Although I am not sure about my future goal, I think I will gradually establish my own research direction while learning. I have a lot of hobbies,
                I like playing basketball, listening to music and playing video games, I hope to find like-minded friends in the past two years of RMIT study. I also hope that I can achieve good results in these two years.
